#Welcome to my website

Hello, my name is Deekshitha Reddy Kalluru, and currently, I am doing a master's in Data Analytics Engineering at George Mason University. Ever since I had my introduction to the power of data and insightful analysis, solving lots of complex problems through insights, I have always been drawn toward it. My academic background started with laying very strong foundations in the undergraduate study of Computer Science in Artificial Intelligence, which made me more passionate about technology and innovation. I am most interested in how data can help drive decision-making and create impacts within industries like healthcare and business. Outside of academic pursuits, I read about new advances in machine learning and ways to apply it in real challenges. This is a path of constant growth in knowledge and skill in the area of data analytics, so that one day I may make great contributions toward meaningful data-driven solutions that create lasting impacts.
